Tools Need to Download:
	1. JCreator Pro 4.5
		Download Link: http://www.jcreator.com/download.htm
	2. JDK 1.7.0
		Download Link: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Install those tools in Windows 8/7. Install JDK before installing JCreator.

** General Prefix Transposition folder contains the java code of prefix transposition without permutation tree (Linked List).
   Here is a file named test.txt which contains the data that will be used to experiment. What data we need to
   experiment, we will paste that in test.txt. Or there is another option, you can open the NewGenPrefix.java
   file and change the file name from program to the data containg text file.
   
   To conduct the experiment, open NewGenPrefix.java file in JCreator then build and then run. After successful
   operation the output window will appear showing the results.
   
** To conduct the experiment of prefix transposition with permutation tree, you will need to create an empty new project
	in JCreator. Then include all the files contained in folder Prefix Transposition using Permutation Tree to the newly
	created project. Then build the project and then run. If everything is fine then project will run and after successful
	operation an output window will appear showing the output. Remember in this case data file is test.txt. So to experiment
	on different data, paste the content of that file to test.txt or change the file name opening PTransposition.java

** Tested Data Folder contains four types of data folders.
	1. Random Data Folder contains Random Data
	2. Real Genome Data Folder contains real genome data from http://grafos.cos.ufrj.br/bioinfo/Bacillus/
		Go that link and link on a genome type data. Then there is a file named fonte.txt which contains our
		experimental data.
	3. FixedBreakpoint400 folder contains data for fixed number of prefix transpositions.
	4. FixedSize5000 folder contains data for fixed Input Size.
